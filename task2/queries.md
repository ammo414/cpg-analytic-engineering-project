All queries are in mySQL.

1) What are the top 5 brands by receipts scanned for most recent month?
   
2) How does the ranking of the top 5 brands by receipts scanned for the recent month compare to the ranking for the previous month?

The following two queries, which are nearly identical, answers the above two questions. 

```mysql
SELECT b.name, count(b._id) as count_last_month
FROM Brand b
JOIN ReceiptItems i
  ON b.barcode = i.barcode
JOIN Receipts r
  ON i._id = r.rewardsReceiptItemListID
WHERE YEAR(r.createDate) = YEAR(CURDATE() - INTERVAL 1 MONTH)
  AND MONTH(r.createDate) = MONTH(CURDATE() - INTERVAL 1 MONTH)  
GROUP BY b.name
ORDER BY count_last_month DESC 
LIMIT 5


SELECT b.name, count(b._id) as count_month_before_last
FROM Brand b
JOIN ReceiptItems i
  ON b.barcode = i.barcode
JOIN Receipts r
  ON i._id = r.rewardsReceiptItemListID
WHERE YEAR(r.createDate) = YEAR(CURDATE() - INTERVAL 2 MONTH)
  AND MONTH(r.createDate) = MONTH(CURDATE() - INTERVAL 2 MONTH)  
GROUP BY b.name
ORDER BY count_month_before_last DESC 
LIMIT 5
```


3) When considering average spend from receipts with 'rewardsReceiptStatus’ of ‘Accepted’ or ‘Rejected’, which is greater?
4) When considering total number of items purchased from receipts with 'rewardsReceiptStatus’ of ‘Accepted’ or ‘Rejected’, which is greater?

The following query answers both of the above.

```mysql
SELECT rewardsReceiptStatus
  , round(avg(totalSpent),2) AS averageSpent
  , sum(purchasedItemCount) AS totalPurchased
FROM Receipts
WHERE rewardsReceiptStatus = "REJECTED" 
  OR rewardsReceiptStatus = "ACCEPTED"
group by rewardsReceiptStatus

# worth pointing out that 'accepted' is not a value present in the data. Did you mean 'finished'?
```


5) Which brand has the most spend among users who were created within the past 6 months?
6) Which brand has the most transactions among users who were created within the past 6 months?

The following query answers both of the above.

```mysql
SELECT b.name
  , sum(i.itemPrice)
  , count(i.barcode)
FROM Brand b
JOIN ReceiptItems i
  on b.barcode = i.barcode
JOIN Receipts r
  on i.receiptId =  r._id
JOIN Users u
  on r.userId = i._id
WHERE i.createdDate >= CURDATE() - INTERVAL (DAYOFMONTH(CURDATE() -1) DAY - INTERVAL 6 MONTH
group by b._id
```
